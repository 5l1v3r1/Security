This is a very rudimentary virus created by Professor Avi Kak of
Purdue University.  It does nothing dangerous, just proof-of-concept
(PoC) and to illustrate the anatomy of a virus:

1. Wait on trigger event (e.g., open/execute it)
2. Replicate to files
and disk
3. On trigger event, payload is executed (note: it does not
perform propagation)
